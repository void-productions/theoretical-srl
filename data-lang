data-lang = Data Language.

A complete data-lang is a any language, which is capable of describing any system with *infinite* code.
Data Language is a language required for the [data-repr-interpretation].
There is no concept of proving in data-languages.

A Data Language L1 is complete,
if there is no other Language L2,
which can represent the [data-lang] code D in infinite code,
which can't be represented in L1 in inifinite code.

To prove that, you can [reduce-data-lang]s to each other.
